          <p><strong style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">Welcome</strong> to the personal and professional website of Kenneth Rossato, Software Consultant in the Washington, DC metro region.  I teach teams to overcome obstacles that slow or block software creation by co-developing tools and processes for safe, rapid experimentation and improvement.  I have consulted on platform migrations, performance profiling and optimization, Linux kernel interfaces, Linux package development, package distribution, configuration management, continuous integration, containerization, and container orchestration.  I have a special passion for native-compiled applications for Linux cloud, edge, and embedded platforms.</p>
