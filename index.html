<p><strong style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">Welcome</strong> to the personal and professional website of Kenneth (Ken) Rossato, software consultant in the Washington, DC metro region.  I have a passion for helping teams develop stable, high-performance C, C++, and Go applications in Cloud, Edge, and Embedded environments, working primarily in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift Container Platform.</p>

<p>As a consultant, I have performed platform migrations, performance profiling and optimization, consulted on Linux kernel interfaces, Linux package development, package distribution, configuration management, continuous integration, containerization, and container orchestration.  I am skilled at debugging application correctness, memory safety, concurrency issues, and efficient network communication and message passing.
